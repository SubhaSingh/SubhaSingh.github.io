      <title>Running a Company like an Engine Without Oil</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This is a satirical blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An engine without oil is a company that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is big enough to split employees into various separate departments/teams with each team having it&amp;rsquo;s own manager but has their upper management be present in every team&amp;rsquo;s work prioritization meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That makes sure their hiring process involves numerous stages to ensure they pick the best of the lot, measuring their competency and their ability to fit in with company culture, but then once they&amp;rsquo;re hired, makes sure they never truly have any autonomy and ownership of any of their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets themselves as agile, having adopted all the agile principles, but ensures management&amp;rsquo;s style of micromanagement impedes any agile productivity gains. There must be bottlenecks all the way down. This is an absolute necessity. No one can move a spoon without management&amp;rsquo;s approval first. No one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must always prioritize work in the most unsustainable way possible and, despite this, must also possess lofty short term plans to rapidly expand the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have management micromanage to the point that it breeds mediocrity and blind acceptance. It is imperative that each employee know the worthlessness of their opinions. They will be indulged and agreed with but there will be no action taken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employees must know that they must always just do what they&amp;rsquo;re told and not to think independently. Yes they may have experience or qualifications but what does that matter really. Those star potential employees must be driven out the door at all costs lest they threaten to shine a light on management&amp;rsquo;s toxic culture, myopic vision, flawed strategy and controlling nature. There must be no stars, just drones, after all how can they know better than management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management themselves must not waste their precious time on crafting a positive company culture, the company&amp;rsquo;s vision and strategy for the future and least of all trusting the people they hired to get the job done. That is an absolute no-no. They must direction all their efforts deciding if department X should be working on A or B this week - something the manager of that department with Y years of experience could handle easily enough but why risk it when the success of the company is at stake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that management micromanages the intelligence, creativity, autonomy and ownership out of a company to truly be an engine without oil.  This way it rapidly steers the company towards a cloud of smoke and significant engine damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The enemies of productivity and those that hold teams back from achieving greatness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mountain out of a molehill maker: that colleague that takes more time to complain about something not working than it takes to actually implement the workaround for that thing that is not working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The never available colleague whose calendar is perpetually empty but does not have time to meet or respond to your slack messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The colleague who is here for the title, not the responsibility. They’re most likely friends with the pass the buck colleague who shuffles the blame around so it doesn’t land in their lap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The self absorbed colleague who is always unnecessarily loud and intentionally disrupts everyone else just so they are noticed and seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gossiper who has a full time contract but actually works part time in order to fit all the gossiping in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The managers who change the narrative to suit their agenda and lack consistency leaving their teams in a constant environment of uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The credit takers who take credit for another’s work or their team’s work (good luck fostering trust after that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that thrive in, and maintain, an environment that lacks transparency because it benefits them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably more enemies to productivity I have not mentioned above, these are just some that I have encountered thus far in my career. We are not perfect people, at any point in time we could be one of these colleagues, but colleagues who are given the opportunity to always be these people ruin any chance for your team to be great. There is no “I” in team and no place for colleagues with these permanent dispositions on great teams.&lt;/p&gt;
