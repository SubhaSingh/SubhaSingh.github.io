&lt;p&gt;Honesty is a very expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people. - Warren Buffet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honesty and integrity are very rare qualities. You are the sum of those you surround yourself with so don&amp;rsquo;t be cheap. Be discerning on the path to mastery, achievement and greatness. Look for expensive guides that provide real value and avoid the cheap knockoffs. Cheap people only have their own interests at heart. They will not help you get to where you want to go. Pick your people wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
